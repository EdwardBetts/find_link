* lines count is too high, split find link into separate files
* cache wikipedia pages to improve performance and decrease load on wikimedia server
* reimplent diff_view to use JSONP on the client, then feed content back to the server
* use timer to open diff_view for each result, pause 0.5 seconds between
* hide results with no diff

currently search grabs the first three pages, we should set a target number of articles instead.
